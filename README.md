<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
This project can be used as a new, standalone Unity project, installed into an existing project using UPM, or manually imported into a Unity project. 

It needs to be stated that this generator is opinionated in how it is setup within a Unity scene. See the 'Usage' section for more information regarding this.

The generator is setup to run out of the box. You are more than welcome to define your own generation process describe in the 'Usage' section. 

It is opinionated. One of the primary goals was to create a new scene, import the generator and have the scene functionally ready within a few minutes. As such, I opted to implore the use of some outside projects that are defined in the 'Prerequisites and Dependencies' section.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


# Prerequisites and Dependencies
##### All dependencies are internal Unity systems or Unity projects that can be found on the asset store.

**Newer versions of these packages should be compatible.**

- Unity 2022.3.9.f1
	- This project was originally created with Unity 2020.3.5. 2022.3 is required due to improvements in the Burst, Jobs, SpriteShape and TileMap systems
* Unity Burst 1.6.5
* Unity Collections 1.2.3
* Unity Jobs 0.50.0-preview.9
* UniTask 2.2.5
* Unity TileMap 1.0.0
* Unity Sprites 1.0.0
* Universal Render Pipeline 12.1.6
	* This is not a hard requirement. For demonstration using a 2D environment, URP was selected.
* Unity Addressable 1.19.19
* A* Pathfinding Project
	* This is a paid asset. It is the most opinionated sub-system to this generator. Aron does *terrific* work with his asset and A* Pathfinding Project is simply a great asset to use.
	* *This technically is NOT required*
* EasyWallCollider
	* This is a paid asset. It is required if you want to generate primitive 3D colliders in a 2D environment. This is used for 2D games that want to use 3D physics with "2D colliders".

##### Please feel free to contact me with any issues or concerns in regards to the dependencies defined above. We can work around the majority of them if needed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

### Scene Setup
##### Manually
1. Create an empty game object; add a 'Procedural Generator' monobehavior
	1. width="300" height="125"
2. The monobehavior component will look like this

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/u1sUljZ.png"/>
</p>

##### Using Included Prefab
1. If you are using the project repository (forked or cloned the entire Git repo), then you can also simply add the included Procedural Generator Prefab to a scene.
2. The prefab can be found at 

```Directory
Packages\ryan-io-procedural-generator\Assets\Prefabs\procedural-generator
```

   within the Unity Editor.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/vlJnN5K.png"/>
</p>

### Settings

Settings are divided into two groups: 'Map Configuration' and 'SpriteShape Configuration'. 'Map Configuration' contains settings relevant to the map generation, serialization, deserialization, tiles, pathfinding, colliders, events and more. 'SpriteShape Configuration' contains settings relevent to sprite shape generation.

These configurations are isolated from each other for serialization purposes.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/Zo29Hqy.png"/>
</p>

##### Setup

> Setup is intended for high level configuration of the generator. This is the entry point for this package.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/tcauKhp.png"/>
</p>

- State
	- Map Name/Id
		- An identifier for the map. This is used in instantiated game objects and prefabs. All serialized data will append this ID to the file names.
	- IsBuild
		- Typically this should be left to 'No'
		- There are optimizations for 'Yes' in place, but this setting is for runtime generation (not recommended).
	- Run
		- 'Create Map' will run the generator
		- 'Deserialize Map' will deserialize generated data and re-instantiate monobehaviors from this data. 
- Seed
	- These settings allow for a more deterministic approach to procedural generation. Specifying your own seed allows for map generation to be more predictable. If you want "truly" randomization of each map, select 'Use Random Seed'. Otherwise, define your own (one will be generated if not specified).

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/hMQSyM0.png"/>
</p>

- UseRandomSeed
		- If 'Yes', a seed will be provided for you. If 'No', create your own or use a previously defined seed value
	- Seed
		- The value seed into the generated. Under the hood, is really just a hash code defined in an extension method.
	- LastSeed
		- ReadOnly; the last seed used by the generator
	- LastIteration
		- Readonly; if using the same seed, the iterator will simply increase its value by '1' each time you reuse a seed. This is to prevent overwriting data. Will always be '0' if using random seeds
- Monobehaviors
	- Any required monobehaviors are defined here.
	- At this point in time, the only required monobehavior is the Pathfinder component from the A* Pathfinding Project
	- If this is not set, one will be (try) created. Otherwise, no pathfinding will be calculated
	- Pathfinder
		- Scene reference to a game object that contains the Pathfinder component

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/Khho7Fy.png"/>
</p>

##### Serialize & Deserialize
> This grouping is for saving and loading generated data. Elements that can be serialized are: mesh, pathfinding, map prefab(EXPENSIVE), sprite shape and colliders.
> *** Generating and serializing a map prefab will utilize a non-negligible amount of storage on your hard drive. Take care if you are repeatedly generating maps.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/8fBZ22g.png"/>
</p>

- Iteration Tracker
	- Name Seed Iteration
		- This is a drop down that contains a list of all maps that have been generated AND serialized. If you do not serialize a map, the name seed iteration will not be added to this collection.
		- Selecting a value from this drop down will allow you to deserialize or delete the data
- Serialization
	- Select 'Yes' do serialize data when you generate a map. Select 'No' for the elements you do NOT want data serialized for.
- Deserialization
	- These settings work identical to the serialization settings
- Delete Selected Serialized Button
	- The value of NameSeedIteration will have all of its data deleted.

##### Map 

> These settings control the characteristics of your maps. Each setting will have a short written description, followed by two pictures contrasting the difference between values at the low and high end.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/0bWaEKJ.png"/>
</p>

- Columns
	- The number of columns the map should generate
- Rows
	- The number of rows the map should gneerate
- CellSize
	- Scalar factor for how 'large' a cell should be
	- **Setting this to a value other than '1' make a few algorithms run with a quadratic time complexity
- **Columns X Rows = TotalNumberOfCells
- BorderSize
	- An optional border around the map
- SmoothingIterations
	- How many times to run all algorithms on a generated map
	- There are diminishing returns for high values, and not post-processing for lower values.
	- 'Correct' vales can give a more a map with a more purposeful layout
- WallRemovalThreshold
	- How many cells can be in a cluster that do NOT enclose open space (think a room).
	- And example of this:

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/urRNijf.png"/>
</p>

   - The larger the number, the less stand alone walls there will be. The small the number, the more there will be. This can make maps feel and appear more dense. 
   - Lower numbers are great if you want to a lot of obstacles in your map(s).
 
##### WallRemovalThreshold = 50

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/zzWnbZk.png"/>
</p>

##### WallRemovalThreshold = 3000

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/YUbKq0B.png"/>
</p>

- RoomRemovalThreshold
	- Analogous to WallRemovalThreshold, but for rooms
	- A room is defined as open/free map space that is enclose by a wall.
	- An example of a room:

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/MsQNy0m.png"/>
</p>

   - Notice the area circle in 'red' is not closed off. This is an example of a passage
   - **Rooms are not entirely isolated from other rooms. One of the generator's constraints is to create maps where all rooms are connected.

##### RoomRemovalThreshold = 50

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/5PqSAGA.png"/>
</p>

##### RoomRemovalThreshold = 3000
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/pEJPZzg.png"/>
</p>
- LowerNeighborLimit
	- The minimum number of cells that are generated as a cluster.
	- This setting has DRASTIC consequences for a value too lower or too high
	- Play around with it; I've used it as a simple customization option during my testing.
	- **A value of '4' is appropriate for MOST maps
- UpperNeighborLimit
	- The maximum number of cells that are generated as a cluster.
	- This setting has DRASTIC consequences for a value too lower or too high
	- Play around with it; I've used it as a simple customization option during my testing.
	- **A value of 6 is appropriate for MOST maps.
- WallFillPercentage
	- How dense the map is.
	- Higher values will yield less rooms generated
	- Lower values will yield more rooms genereated. Too low of a value and the map will appear empty.
	- Values are limited between 40 & 55. The generation algorithm is very sensitive to fluctuations of this value. **47 is the default**.
##### WallFillPercentage = 47
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/yvdADGD.png"/>
</p>
##### WallFillPercentage  = 45
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/yo5kYrk.png"/>
</p>
##### WallFillPercentage = 40
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/C4dG53v.png"/>
</p>
##### WallFillPercentage = 49
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/jp8o0Uf.png"/>
</p>
##### WallFillPercentage = 55
<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/M3wDv9v.png"/>
</p>
- CorridorWidth
	- How wide or narrow each connected room passageway is
	- Below is an example with CorridorWidth => {3, 5}
		- SOME passageways are circled in 'red'.

<p align="center">
<img  src="https://i.imgur.com/cdhfyEz.png"/>
</p>

- GroundLayerMask
	- What layer mask the 'ground' should be on.
- ObstacleLayerMask
	- What layer mask 'obstacles' should be on.
- BoundaryLayerMask
	- What layer ask the 'boundary' of the map should be on.
- MeshMaterial
	- Optional: the material to apply to the generated mesh
	- The example below shows a 'salmon' colored (very generic) material applied to a generated mesh
